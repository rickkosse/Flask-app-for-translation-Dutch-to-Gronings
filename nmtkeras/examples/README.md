# NMT-Keras/examples

This folder contains some examples and tutorials showing how the library works.
 
## On the tutorials

**WARNING**: Almost all variables and parameters in tutorials representing model hyperparameters have been intentionally hardcoded, aiming to  facilitate readability. On a real execution, these values are taken from the `config.py` file.
 
There are 2 colab notebooks:
 
 * An introduction to a complete NMT experiment: [![Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lvapeab/nmt-keras/blob/master/examples/tutorial.ipynb) 
  * A dissected NMT model: [![Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lvapeab/nmt-keras/blob/master/examples/modeling_tutorial.ipynb) 
 
These tutorials basically are a split version of the execution pipeline of the library. 
   
The translation task is *EuTrans* ([Amengual et al.](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1011116115948)), a toy-task mainly used for debugging purposes.
Since it is an easy task, the model should converge in few (~6-8) epochs, yielding a BLEU-4 score close to 1 in the case of the Es->En language direction.

## Advanced configs
 
The `configs` folder contains two `config` files, which declare larger, "real-life" models. They are shown as a reference for more complex tasks, but they should be tuned and modified for each task. 


## On the documentation

In the `documentation` folder you'll some docuementation files:

* [neural_machine_translation.pdf](https://github.com/lvapeab/nmt-keras/blob/master/examples/documentation/neural_machine_translation.pdf) contains a (theoretical) overview of an attentional NMT system.
* [staged_keras_wrapper.pdf](https://github.com/lvapeab/nmt-keras/blob/master/examples/documentation/staged_keras_wrapper.pdf) contains the autogenerated documentation for the staged_keras_wrapper package (at 30/Nov/2016).
* [typical_output.md](https://github.com/lvapeab/nmt-keras/blob/master/examples/documentation/typical_output.md) describes the files and output generated during a typical training run.
* [ensembling_tutorial.md](https://github.com/lvapeab/nmt-keras/blob/master/examples/documentation/ensembling_tutorial.md) shows the usage of the `sample_ensemble` script.

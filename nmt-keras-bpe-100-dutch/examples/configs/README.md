# NMT-Keras/examples/configs

This folder contains two configuration files, shown as a reference. They should be taken into account for having an intuition of larger models, but they should be tuned and modified for each task. 
 
**WARNING**: These configs assume that the text has been preprocessed and split into subwords (with [Byte Pair Encoding](https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt/)). For applying this preprocessing, you can use [this script](https://github.com/lvapeab/scripts/blob/master/apply_joint_bpe_to_corpus.sh).
